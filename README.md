## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### What I learned

I'm really proud of completing this project on my own, especially considering how frustrating I’ve found calculator-type challenges in the past! Along the way, I deepened my understanding of `useState` and learned how to add custom types, which helped me implement a 3-option toggle feature.

### Continued development

I’m now feeling confident and ready to tackle a MERN + Next.js + Framer Motion + TypeScript project (the classic **to-do list app** will be the perfect test). Wish me luck!
